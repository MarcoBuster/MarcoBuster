# Hi! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Marco, and I am a Computer Science student @ UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Milano since 2020.
I am currently working on [StudentiUniMi](https://github.com/StudentiUniMi), an organization which offers web services and Telegram groups to students of University of Milan. 

Since 14, I like to develop little things and share them with the world! 
I truly believe in **free software** *(as freedom, not as beer!)* so
I share the source code and I make it free everytime I can.
