# Hi! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Marco, and I am a Computer Science student @ UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Milano since 2020.
I am a part-time teacher in a private local high school, too.

Since 14, I like to develop little things and share them with the world! 
I truly believe in **free software** *(as freedom, not as beer!)* so
I share the source code and I make it free everytime I can. 
Up next, here's some projects: 

### Telegram
- [botogram](https://github.com/python-botogram/botogram) (maintainer): Python framework to develop Telegram bots; I use it mostly in all projects
- [OrarioTreniBot](https://github.com/MarcoBuster/OrarioTreniBot): Telegram bot for italian trains
- [data-clustering-contest](https://github.com/MarcoBuster/data-clustering-contest): My submission for Telegram [Data Clustering Contest](https://t.me/contest/131)
- [ClasseVivaBot](https://github.com/MarcoBuster/ClasseVivaBot): Telegram bot for ClasseViva / Spaggiari eletronic register
- and many more...

### Other
- [unihome](https://github.com/MarcoBuster/unihome): a web directory to find the correct resource in my university website
- [immuni-tek-sender](https://github.com/MarcoBuster/immuni-tek-sender): sends a Telegram notification when a new exposure key batch is added to the [Immuni](https://github.com/immuni-app) keyserver
